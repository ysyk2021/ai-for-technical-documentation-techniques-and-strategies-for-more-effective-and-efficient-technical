Before implementing artificial intelligence (AI) tools and technologies in technical documentation, it's essential to assess your technical writing needs and goals. This includes understanding your audience, identifying pain points in your current workflows, and determining the specific functions you need from AI tools. In this chapter, we will discuss how to prepare for AI implementation by assessing your technical writing needs and goals.

Understanding Your Audience
---------------------------

Understanding your audience is critical to creating effective technical documentation. Before implementing AI, consider the following questions:

* Who is your audience?
* What are their needs and expectations?
* How do they interact with technical documentation?

By understanding your audience, you can ensure that the AI tools and technologies you implement are tailored to their needs and preferences.

Identifying Pain Points in Current Workflows
--------------------------------------------

Identifying pain points in your current technical writing workflows is critical to determining the specific functions you need from AI tools. Consider the following questions:

* What are the most time-consuming tasks in your current workflows?
* Where are the bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your workflows?
* What tasks could be automated to increase efficiency and productivity?

By identifying pain points in your current workflows, you can determine which AI tools and technologies will best meet your needs and streamline your processes.

Determining Specific Functions Needed from AI Tools
---------------------------------------------------

Determining the specific functions you need from AI tools and technologies is critical to selecting the right tools for your organization. Consider the following questions:

* What specific tasks do you want to automate?
* Which AI tools and technologies are best suited for those tasks?
* How can AI be used to enhance the user experience of your technical documentation?

By determining the specific functions you need from AI tools, you can select tools that align with your objectives and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your technical writing.

Conclusion
----------

Assessing your technical writing needs and goals is critical to preparing for AI implementation in technical documentation. By understanding your audience, identifying pain points in your current workflows, and determining the specific functions you need from AI tools, you can select the right tools and technologies to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your technical writing. As AI technology continues to evolve, it's essential to remain vigilant and proactive in assessing your technical writing needs and goals to ensure that you are taking advantage of the latest AI innovations.
